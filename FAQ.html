FAQ's
</h2>
<h3>From Applicants:</h3>
<p><strong>What is the password for the on-line concept application form?</strong></p>
<p>cfh2016 - all lowercase.</p>
<p><strong>What are the deadlines?</strong></p>
<p>The foundation has two 4-month funding cycles each year. The first begins in January and ends in May. The second begins in
	September and ends in December.</p>
<p>Concept applications received before January 1 will be considered for eligibility for the March 1 full proposal deadline.
	Grant payout for this cycle will be in June.</p>
<p>Concept applications received before July 1 will be considered for eligibility for the September 1 full proposal deadline.
	Grant payout for this cycle will be in December.</p>
<p><strong>I don&rsquo;t have a U.S. charity number to register in your system. &nbsp;How do I register?</strong></p>
<p>Type 12-1234567 instead. The grants application system of the Conservation, Food, & Health Foundation is not
	set up to accept international tax identification numbers.</p>
<p><strong>May I fax or e-mail my concept application or proposal?</strong></p>
<p>No. Use the <a href="https://www.grantinterface.com/gma/Common/LogOn.aspx">online application tool.
</a></p>
<p><strong>Will the foundation support indirect costs or administrative overhead?</strong></p>
<p>No. You have a better chance of competing for scarce dollars if you allocate direct costs to the CFH grant.</p>
<p><strong>May we submit our application in a language other than English?</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately, we lack the capacity to translate proposals submitted in other languages.</p>
<p><strong>Can an organization submit two concept applications for consideration?</strong></p>
<p>In fairness to other organizations seeking support, we ask that organizations submit only one concept application per round
	of funding.</p>
<p><strong>Does the foundation provide multi-year funding?</strong></p>
<p>The foundation does not make multi-year grants. Applicants must re-apply through the competitive grants process each year.
	The foundation provides continued funding on a case-by-case basis depending on the past success of the project.</p>
<p><strong>Will the foundation support international travel costs?</strong></p>
<p>The foundation prefers to maximize the impact of its grant dollars by supporting local project expenses. &nbsp;The money
	spent on one plane ticket, for example, could support the salary of a health worker, researcher, or agricultural extension
	agent for several months. That being said, the foundation may consider supporting a small portion of travel expenses when
	costs are an integral and reasonable part of the project budget.</p>
<p><strong>Will the foundation support fellowships, scholarships, and training activities for university students?</strong></p>
<p>The foundation does not pay for tuition or scholarships. &nbsp;The foundation prefers to support the research project costs
	of early-career or emerging professionals from low- and middle&nbsp; income countries who: 1) are working in the field on
	specific issues that address priority research concerns in its main areas of support, and 2) demonstrate leadership potential
	in their field in their home countries. &nbsp;These grants are relatively rare.</p>
<p><strong>Will the foundation support comprehensive village level anti-poverty programs that address the intersection of conservation, food, and health?</strong></p>
<p>The foundation prefers to support projects that have potential for broad applicability to other organizations or communities.
	&nbsp;It seldom funds projects that only have a local impact. One-third of all concept applications reviewed by the
	foundation are not considered for funding because they seek support for very general village improvement efforts, basic
	organic farming, animal husbandry training projects, or for general operating support.</p>
<p><strong>Are there things that the foundation hardly ever funds?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Humanitarian aid programs, missionary programs, and social service programs:</strong>&nbsp; Feeding programs, emergency
	medical care, missionary organizations, and other direct social services to populations in urgent need are not a priority
	of the foundation.</p>
<p><strong>Projects with primary a local emphasis:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; The foundation prefers to support specific projects
	and strategies which have potential for broad applicability to other organizations or communities.</p>
<p><strong>Village improvement and basic farmer training programs:</strong>&nbsp; Generalized village improvement efforts, basic
	organic farming, animal husbandry training projects, or for general operating support for agricultural extension programs
	are not a top priority.</p>
<p><strong>Capital requests:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; The foundation does not fund capital improvement projects, large equipment
	purchases or funds to build buildings, water systems, pumps, wells, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Limited financial capacity:</strong>&nbsp; The foundation rarely makes grants that exceed 25% of an organization&rsquo;s
	total operating budget.&nbsp; It also rarely funds start-up organizations with limited track records.</p>
<p><strong>Microenterprise, ecotourism, and livelihood projects:</strong>&nbsp; The foundation does not fund economic development,
	livelihood, or microenterprise projects.&nbsp; It recognizes the important link between conservation and livelihoods but
	does not emphasize this dimension in its support of sustainable agriculture or conservation programs.</p>
<p><strong>Publications and media:</strong>&nbsp; The foundation rarely supports publications.</p>
<p><strong>Social science research:</strong>&nbsp; The foundation gives priority to requests that reflect a deep understanding
	of the social, political, and economic dimensions of its interest areas but channels its limited resources toward applied
	research projects in the natural and health sciences.</p>
<p><strong>Medical care:</strong>&nbsp; The foundation&rsquo;s emphasis on prevention over treatment means that it does not
	make grants for primary medical care service delivery programs at clinics or hospitals.&nbsp; It favors health promotion
	and family planning initiatives that are critical of current practice and have the potential to provide fresh insight that
	can advance the field.</p>
<h3>From Current Grantees:</h3>
<p><strong>May we reapply for funding next year?</strong></p>
<p>Grantees may submit a proposal for continued funding if the project substantially continues the work of the currently funded
	project. In other words, if you need money for a totally new project or a very new direction or phase of the current project,
	please submit a new concept application.</p>
<p><strong>Should current grantees submit a concept application to request continued support?</strong></p>
<p>Only if they are seeking support for a totally new project. Please notify us as soon as possible if you plan to resubmit.</p>
<p><strong>How do we reapply for funding?</strong></p>
<p>Follow the proposal instructions on the website as in the past. The proposal guidelines and forms may change from year to
	year, so make sure your information is up to date.</p>
<p><strong>If we reapply, should we complete the entire form again including the attachments?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. Do not assume that the reviewers remember your organization or your work. The foundation reviews many similar requests.
	Having all of the information readily available will help the reviewers answer questions that may support their understanding
	of the project.</p>
<p><strong>When do we report on the project?</strong></p>
<p>We encourage you to keep us up to date about the project.&nbsp; Complete an&nbsp;interim report with any request for follow-up
	support. Please complete&nbsp;a final report at the end of the grant period or project phase. Even if the particular phase
	of your project is not completed by the time you spend all of the grant money, let us know when you will complete&nbsp;a
	final accounting of the project. All reports are can be completed on the foundation&rsquo;s online application portal.</p>
<p><strong>How should we report?</strong></p>
<p>Please follow the 
	<a href="./guidelines">guidelines provided by the foundation</a>.</p>
