		<h2>Guidelines</h2>
<p>
The Conservation, Food and Health Foundation seeks to protect natural resources, improve the production and distribution
of food, and promote public health in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East. The foundation helps build the capacity
of organizations and coalitions with grants that support research or improve the learning and generation of local solutions
to complex problems.</p>
<p>The foundation supports projects that demonstrate local leadership and promote professional development
in the conservation, agricultural, and health sciences; develop the capacity of local organizations; and address a particular
problem or question in the field. It prefers to support projects that address under-funded issues and geographic areas. 
<p>

<h3> Geographic Focus </h3> 
<p>
The foundation supports low- and lower-middle-income countries in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East.
It prefers to support organizations located in low- and middle-income countries or organizations located in upper-income
countries whose activities are of direct benefit low- and middle-income countries. The foundation does not support the states
of the former Soviet Union or former Eastern Bloc countries.

reporting requirements within one year of the previous proposal application. Returning applicants should submit an interim
